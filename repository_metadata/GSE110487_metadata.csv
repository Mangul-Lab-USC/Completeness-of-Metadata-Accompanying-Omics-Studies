Trimming performed with Trimmomatic v0.35, with following parameters: MINLEN:40, AVGQUAL:25 and TRAILING:15
Trimmed reads aligned to GRCh38 using STAR v.2.5.2b using as reference transcript the gencode (v.25) primary assembly gene transfer file (GTF).
Gene counting performed on files including only uniquely mapped fragments using featurecounts v1.5.1 with custom parameters: --minOverlap 5; only both reads, no multimapping.
