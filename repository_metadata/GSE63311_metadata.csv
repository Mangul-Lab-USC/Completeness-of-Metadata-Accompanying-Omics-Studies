Reads were initially mapped to Ensembl transcripts with the search for novel junctions disabled. Genomic coordinates were then transformed into counts of protein-coding Ensembl genes. To do this, a chimeric gene-model was first defined by merging all protein-coding transcripts for a given gene. Transcripts that had reads in less than 50% of their exons in all samples were defined as not expressed and were excluded from the chimeric transcriptome.
Reads that overlapped the chimeric genes were counted using the htseq-count script in the intersection-nonempty mode (http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/doc/count.html). The script discards multi-mapped reads as well as reads that overlap multiple distinct genes, to generate a file of uniquely mapped gene counts.
